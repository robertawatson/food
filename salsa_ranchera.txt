Grill
Place all peppers and tomatoes over open fire at 600 degrees Farenheit. Turn tomatoes and peppers and grill until all sides are partially blackened. The tomatoes should finish first (try to not let them explode). 

As each vegetable becomes sufficiently grilled, remove it and place it in a bowl and then cover to continue to steam. 

After allowing the vegetables to sit & cool, peel the blackened skin off each of the vegetables (discard the skin). Pulse all peppers and tomatoes together, stopping short of the desired consistency. Add diced onion, minced garlic, and chopped cilantro. Continue to blend together until desired consistency is acheived.

Optional

Serrano peppers can be increased or decreased to modify the heat. Other peppers can be used as well, such as a habanero to increase spiciness, or a jalapeno to decrease spiciness. Removing seeds from any pepper will also reduce the heat, as this is where the capsacin is located. 

The onion can be grilled with the other vegetables as well.
